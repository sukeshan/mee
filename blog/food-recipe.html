                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Most of the time the user doesn’t have an ingredient of SE-recommended recipes. To address this
                    problem I
                    created a search engine that will retrieve food recipes based on the user-given food ingredients
                    instead of user-given food recipes.</p>

                <h3>Dataset</h3>
                <p>We scraped data from online websites such as Times of India and All recipes. We scraped recipe
                    title, ingredients, cuisine, category, instructions, recipe image, ratings and webpage link.</p>

                <h3>Model</h3>
                <p>We tried two methodologies for this problem:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Embedding-based technique:</strong> We created embeddings for each ingredient by recipe
                        instructions. To represent recipes in embedding space, we simply average the embeddings of each
                        recipe’s ingredient.</li>
                    <li><strong>Graph-based technique:</strong> Using bipartite graph retrieve recipes simply and
                        effectively. Nodes {RA, RB, RC, RD} belong to Recipes set and nodes {IA, IB, IC, ID}
                        belong to Ingredients set.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ingredient Alternative</h3>
                <p>In some cases, the user doesn’t have an ingredient mentioned in recipe’s instruction. To address this
                    problem
                    created a context based embedding for each ingredient using cosine distance function to recommend an
                    alternative.</p>
