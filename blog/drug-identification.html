            </div>

            <div class="article-content">
                <h3>Project Purpose</h3>
                <p>One day my mom gave a bunch of tablets and asked me to find the purpose of each tablet. I tried to
                    teach my mom to find the purpose of tablets by herself using Google, but she was a little confused.
                    This motivated me to create an app to find the uses of the tablet by using only images.</p>

                <h3>Using Spatial Information</h3>
                <p>I found an insight when I was collecting tablet images: every company prints the drug name in bold
                    font, and the font size is bigger than other words. First I extract the text and its coordinates
                    from the image using OCR and I use three conditions to identify the drug names:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Text Size</li>
                    <li>Keyword Technique</li>
                    <li>Pixel Information</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Text Size</h3>
                <p>We know the drug names are printed in bold and the font size is big compared to others so I wrote
                    conditions to filter the bold and big-size font.</p>

                <h3>Keyword Technique</h3>
                <p>Now we need to find out the keyword “tablet” from the 15 words or sentences filtered by condition-1.
                    Sometimes OCR reads the tablet as tablt or tabalt because of poor image condition, so I split the
                    “tablet” word into N-grams and slide through entire sentences.</p>
